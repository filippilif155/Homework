[Verse 1]
You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park
But meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear the music ring

[Verse 2]
Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the Jazz go down
Competition in other places
Ah, but the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

[Verse 3]
Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

[Verse 4]
And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – he's doing alright
He can play the Honky Tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

[Verse 5]
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole

[Instrumental break 3:20-4:13]
[Guitar solo]

[Verse 6]
And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
"Goodnight, now it's time to go home"
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
"We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing"

[Instrumental Outro 4:46-5:46]
[Guitar solo]

<i>
<pre>
[Verse 1]
People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

[Chorus]
When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange

[Verse 2]
People are strange when you're a stranger
Faces look ugly when you're alone
Women seem wicked when you're unwanted
Streets are uneven when you're down

[Chorus]
When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange
Alright, yeah

[Outro]
When you're strange
Faces come out of the rain
When you're strange
No one remembers your name
When you're strange
When you're strange
When you're strange

<h1 id = "song_3">John Denver – Take Me Home, Country Roads</h1>
<i>
<pre>
[Verse 1]
Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

[Verse 2]
All my memories gather 'round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrops in my eyes

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

[Bridge]
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

[Chorus]
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

[Outro]
Take me home, (Down) country roads
Take me home, (Down) country roads

[Intro]
Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world, I'll turn it inside out, yeah
I'm floating around in ecstasy, so (Don't stop me now)
(Don't stop me) 'Cause I'm havin' a good time, havin' a good time

[Verse 1]
I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go, there's no stopping me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic man outta you

[Chorus]
(Don't stop me now)
I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball
(Don't stop me now)
If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call
(Don't stop me now) 'Cause I'm having a good time
(Don't stop me now) Yes, I'm having a good time
I don't wanna stop at all, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars on a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I'm a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode!

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit
I'm travelling at the speed of light
I wanna make a supersonic woman of you

[Bridge]
(Don't stop me, don't stop me, don't stop me) Hey, hey, hey
(Don't stop me, don't stop me, ooh, ooh, ooh) I like it
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) Have a good time, good time
(Don't stop me, don't stop me) Woah
Let loose, honey, all right

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees, that's why they call me Mister Fahrenheit, hey
Travelling at the speed of light
I wanna
make a supersonic man outta you (Yeah, yeah)

<h1 id = "song_5">Jimmie Rodgers – A Drunkard's Child Lyrics</h1>
<i>
<pre>
[Verse 1]
My father is a drunkard my mother she is dead
And I am just an orphan child no place to lay my head
All through this world I wander they drive me from their door
Someday I'll find a welcome on heaven's golden shore

[Verse 2]
Now if to me you'll listen I'll tell a story sad
How drinking rum and the gambling hell have stole away my dad
My mother she is in heaven where God and the angels smile
And now I know she's watching her lonely orphan child

[Chorus]
[?]

[Verse 3]
We were once so happy and had a happy home
Till daddy went to drinking rum and then he gambled some
He left my darling mother she died of a broken heart
And as I tell my story I can see your teardrops start

[Verse 4]
Don't weep for me and mother although I know it is sad
But try to find someone to cheer and save my poor lonely dad
I'm awful cold and hungry she closed her eyes and sighed
Then those who heard her story knew the orphan child had died

[Chorus]
